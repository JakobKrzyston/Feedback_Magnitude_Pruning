# About
This repo is for my submission to **ITU-ML5G-PS-007: Lightning-Fast Modulation Classification with Hardware-Efficient Neural Networks**.
The goal of the competition was to created the fastest* and most efficient* deep learning architecture that could achieve a minimum of 56% classificaiton accuracy on the  DeepSig RadioML 2018 dataset.

*Speed and efficiency metrics are defined at: https://challenge.aiforgood.itu.int/match/matchitem/34
